# LLM with GPT-3.5 Turbo Model

This is an LLM (Large Language Model) trained using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model and its API. The model is integrated with Streamlit, a Python library for the front end. It takes in user queries and provides answers based on the data present in the `Data` folder. The model has been fine-tuned to specifically address these questions.
To be more specific the user can select the year based on which they want the results to be from and the model will give its responses based on said selected year.
The connection between the model and the user interface is established using an API provided by OpenAI itself.

**How to Run:**
Clone this project and run using: streamlit run app.py

**Model Training:**
This model will train according to the data present in the `Data` folder.
